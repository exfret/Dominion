 TODO
   1) Finish implementing base game and base cards
     DONE A: Make function for transitioning to next player's turn
     DONE B: Make a function for buying cards
     DONE C: Make a function for playing cards
     D: Test for victory conditions
   DONE 2) Make interface for interacting with game
   DONE 3) Add types and names for cards
   DONE 4) Make ordered card use vector<int> as an ordering
   DONE 5) Allow viewing other player's info
   6) Add info on cards
   7) Add function to print out all information about game state
   8) Add a function for possible game choices
   9) Make some basic functionality for playing turns for the AI
     - Basically, handhold some part of the decision process for it
   10) Make a log
   11) Create multi-action capability in a single command so that there's less I/O needed
   12) Add undo functionality
   13) Add destructors (to prevent memory leaks)
   14) Make interface to play with bot in a real game and input what's happening in the computer
 
 IDEA: Split up AI into two AI's - a strategic one for buy phase and a tactical one for action phase?
